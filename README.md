# 🖥️ Computational Systems Research (2025)

This project explores how **modern computational methods** can be applied to improve the performance, scalability, and adaptability of complex systems. Using encryption algorithms as the case study, the work evaluates how advanced techniques—particularly **machine learning (ML)**—compare with traditional approaches when systems are required to handle large-scale data, evolving conditions, and real-time decision-making.

The goal of the project is not only to study cryptography, but to demonstrate a **general engineering workflow**: conducting a structured literature review, designing a simulation-based experiment, and analyzing trade-offs in reliability, efficiency, and adaptability.
